# Apophis SDK Roadmap

- [x] Amino signing (Cosmos)
- [ ] Prevent duplicate middleware registration
- [ ] Hardware wallet detection
- [ ] Cosmos Tips (not sure what exactly those are)
- [ ] Direct Ledger support
- [ ] Direct KeyStone support
- [ ] Direct Trezor support
- [ ] Solana/SVM support
- [ ] Ethereum/EVM support
- [ ] [Keplr suggests](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet/blob/0584dc236796de4b9fc287c2617d06dc044ba71e/packages/background/src/tx/service.ts#L77) there is a 'POST /txs' endpoint that seems to be obsolete since the introduction of protobuf. However, it is possible (albeit unlikely) that some old chains do not support protobuf and the new endpoints yet.
