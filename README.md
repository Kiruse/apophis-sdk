# Apophis SDK
Apohis SDK is a Work-in-Progress, extensible Cosmos blockchain Dapp SDK, designed to be a frontend-agnostic one-stop shop for Dapp developers. At this stage, only an integration for Preact exists, though I am still actively working on the SDK and will be adding more integrations as I go.

Apophis SDK is named after [the near-Earth asteroid 99942 Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis), the obscure interloper of the Sol system.

See the [GitBook](https://kirudev-oss.gitbook.io/apophis-sdk/) for more information.
